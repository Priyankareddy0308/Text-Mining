       "\"Rules of the game -- We focus on the roles that institutions play relative to information behavior. Our working definition of institution is the formal and informal constraints that form the basis for exchange, relationships, and decision-making. We know that institutions play significant roles in the creation, management, and uses of information. And, scholars have long recognized that institutions have both direct and indirect impacts on the sustainability and ethical value of information. What is less clear are the ways in which institutions and people's information behaviors are mutually-constituted. The goal of this panel is to highlight particular opportunities for expanding the current and modest level of attention to studying the roles of human institutions relative to information. To do so, this panel will involve the audience in a lively conversation about how information science views the role of institutions in information behavior. It includes a participatory design structured activity that will engage the audience in identifying how existing threads of research are making contributions and key areas of further inquiry. The panel will begin with dialogue sharing insights of scholars and practitioners who are interested in data goverce, information behavior, organization of information, and knowledge management. Then the panel will engage the audience in an interactive activity that explores emerging research streams and questions.; Membership has its privileges? Contracting and access to jobs that accommodate work-life needs -- Using job-spell data based on an original survey of Information Technology (IT) degree graduates from five U.S. universities, the authors investigate the link between contracting and a set of job characteristics (accommodating flexible work hours, total work hours, and working from home) associated with work-life needs. Compared with regular employees in similar jobs, workers in both independent- and agency-contracting jobs report more often working at home and working fewer hours per week. Further, agency contracting (but not independent contracting) is associated with lower odds of being able to set one's own work hours. Important differences also emerge in workplaces of varying sizes. For each job characteristic, as workplace size increases, independent contracting jobs deteriorate relative to regular employment jobs. As a consequence, in large workplaces, independent contracting jobs appear to be less accommodating of work-life needs than regular employment jobs.; The Five-Dimensional Space of the Futures of Work -- We advance a structured view of the Futures of Work (FoW) using a futurist’s lens to advance two goals: advancing core dimensions to the FoW while outlining the Futurist’s approach to considering possible futures. Professional futurists point out that they do not predict the future, but rather, build a number of futures – in plural. These views of the futures are presented as scenarios to help decision makers consider alternatives and better understand interactions among the planning dimensions. The scenarios that drive planning are constructed by drawing on characteristics or dimensions that will shape our futures. It is these dimensions that we present here. We offer five foundational dimensions for the FoW, articulating them as opposing perspectives to frame the issue: (1) Virtuality versus Compressed working arrangements; (2) Atomistic work versus Holistic work; (3) Algorithmic versus Human decision-making; (4) Neoliberal capitalism versus Safety-net capitalism; (5) Übermensch versus Nihilists. We use these dimensions to provide scenarios to illustrate their use. We conclude by reflecting on the shock of the 2020 pandemic and the roles of firm size relative to the futures of work.; Design observations for interagency collaboration -- We present 14 design observations for public safety networks (PSNs) and describe how they may apply more broadly to a wider range of inter-organizational systems within the public sector. A PSN is an interagency collaboration focused on developing and using information systems in support of information sharing and functional interoperability among public safety organizations engaged in law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency response. We base our design observations upon an analysis of an extensive survey of 80 PSNs plus 6 in-depth case studies. The design observations identify commonalities that can guide agencies participating in interagency collaborations in addressing the interlocking issues they face. Our goal in presenting this set of design observations is to: (1) encourage improved PSN systems design and (2) draw attention to the importance of jointly addressing goverce and technological considerations when designing PSNs.; Design observations regarding public safety networks -- Through this paper we advance an initial set of 12 observations that will form the basis for developing design principles for public safety networks (PSN), and more broadly for inter-organizational systems within the public sector. A public safety network is an interagency collaboration focused on the development and use of information and communication technologies to support the information sharing and functional interoperability needs of public safety organizations engaged in law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency response. Our goal in presenting this initial set of PSN design observations is to: (1) encourage improved PSN systems design through the development of design principles and (2) increase the attention paid, when designing and developing these forms of information systems, to the co-design of structures of goverce and operation that PSN entail.; Patterns of governance among inter-organizational coordination hubs -- We focus on the goverce of inter-organizational coordination hubs (ICH). We do so to advance conceptual and empirical insights about ICH goverce. We are motivated by the simple observation that, increasingly, organizations are engaging in shared activities, often relying on a purpose-built digital infrastructure to support collaboration among organizations. Here we use the conceptualization of network goverce to guide our analysis of characteristics of goverce that distinguish low and high performing ICH. To do this we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and data from 61 public safety networks (PSN) - A particular form of ICH. The analysis shows there exist six distinct configurations of PSN goverce practices that lead to high performance. Common to all these configurations is competence in managing both stakeholders and the digital infrastructure. Building from the findings, we advance the role of specific competencies and network goverce more broadly.; Governance configurations for inter-organizational coordination -- We focus on networked arrangements of digital resources that are shared among otherwise independent units to advance conceptual and empirical insights about their goverce. We are motivated by the simple observation that, increasingly, independent organizations are engaging in shared activities, often relying on purpose-built digital infrastructures to support this move to inter-dependence. To advance current conceptualizations of networked goverce, we draw on data from 42 public safety networks and use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We do so because fsQCA allows us to account for the realities of inter-dependence among the concepts and variables we consider and to illuminate the multiple viable goverce patterns that are possible. The results show the importance of network-level goverce competencies to manage stakeholders and information infrastructure to achieve high effectiveness of PSN. Analysis makes clear that there exist five configurations of PSN goverce practices that enable high levels of network goverce effectiveness. Common to all these configurations are the network-level competence in managing both stakeholders and the digital infrastructure, suggesting these are necessary (but not sufficient) network-level goverce competencies. Building from the analysis, we advance the role of specific network-level goverce competencies, and the current conceptualization of network goverce more broadly.; Designing Collaborative Networks: Lessons Learned from Public Safety -- ; Social informatics -- ; Requirements engineering blinders -- In this paper we focus empirical and conceptual attention on the social construction of information systems (IS) requirements, and illustrate that IS developers too often choose to ignore, and thus effectively black-box, the complexities of gathering requirements in order to simplify both the difficulties of their work and their relations with customers. The empirical contribution of this paper is evidence drawn from a study of how IS developers pursue requirements engineering and how they conceive its value. The factors we found to be important in this process include: the changing needs of the organization, the ways in which structured IS methods are enacted via experience and social competency, the formation of project groups, and finally engagement in interpersonal conflict and negotiations. Our conceptual contribution is theorization on the nature of developing requirements as a process of social learning.; Theorizing on the take-up of social technologies, organizational policies and norms, and consultants' knowledge-sharing practices -- We identify the effects of specific organizational norms, arrangements, and policies regarding uses of social technologies for informal knowledge sharing by consultants. For this study, the term social technologies refers to the fast-evolving suite of tools such as traditional applications like e-mail, phone, and instant messenger; emerging social networking platforms (often known as social media) such as blogs and wikis; public social networking sites (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn); and enterprise social networking technologies that are specifically hosted within one organization's computing environment (i.e., Socialtext). Building from structuration theory, the analysis presented focuses on the knowledge practices of consultants related to their uses of social technologies and the ways in which organizational norms and policies influence these practices. A primary contribution of this research is a detailed contextualization of social technology uses by knowledge workers. As many organizations are allowing social media-enabled knowledge sharing to develop organically, most corporate policy toward these platforms remains defensive, not strategic, limiting opportunities. Implications for uses and expectations of social technologies arising from this research will help organizations craft relevant policies and rules to best support technology-enabled informal knowledge practices.; Social networking technologies and organizational knowledge sharing as a sociotechnical ecology -- We focus on how the uses of social networking technologies (SNT) are bound up in knowledge sharing practices. For us SNT include weblogs, wikis, corporate social networking platforms, and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Our focus is to the uses of SNT relative to people's informal networks within and across organizations. We conceive these as multidimensional networks, treating technology and humans symmetrically and as members of the same sociotechnical ecology. To date, evidence indicates that SNTs have multiple roles regarding knowledge sharing in organizational contexts, and it appears that uses of SNT advance collaborative practices in ways not fully congruent with contemporary organizational practices.; Social Technologies, Informal Knowledge Practices, and the Enterprise -- This article focuses on the ways in which social technologies facilitate informal knowledge sharing in the workplace. Social technologies include both common technologies such as email, phone, and instant messenger and emerging social networking technologies, often known as social media or Web 2.0, such as blogs, wikis, public social networking sites (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn), enterprise social networking technologies, etc. We know social technologies support informal interactions over digital systems and influence informal social connections among people within and across organizational boundaries. To understand the role of social technologies in informal knowledge practices, we pursue a field study of knowledge workers in consulting firms to investigate the role of social technologies in their informal knowledge sharing practices. Our theorizing from the data is guided by the conceptual premises of sociomateriality to better understand the ways social technologies are integrated with common knowledge practices. Findings highlight five knowledge practices supported by the use of social technologies. Building from these findings we offer conceptual insights regarding the material performance of different social technologies as an assemblage.; Personalization of knowledge, personal knowledge ecology, and digital nomadism -- We examine the concept of personal knowledge management using data drawn from our study of digital nomads. We make two contributions: an empirical and conceptual development of knowledge management as it relates to independent workers and an advancement of social informatics that builds on Gibson's ecological perspective. Digital nomads provide an empirical basis to better understand how knowledge management is shifting from organization-centric, with its concomitant emphasis on organizational information systems, to worker-centric, which relies on personal knowledge ecologies. We advance this concept as a combination of personal knowledge management activities and the digital technologies that support them. Our data make clear that individuals are the locus of personal knowledge ecologies, but these ecologies are embedded in a larger community of collaborators, clients, and peers who are often extensively mediated by digital technologies. This embedding and mediation are at the core of the sociotechnical arrangements that define the personal knowledge ecologies that we document.; Networks of innovation -- We theorize on the heterogonous network of people, visions, concepts, technological artifacts, and organizations that come together to enable product innovation. Drawing on the conceptual framing and mechanisms of actor-network theory (ANT), we focus on the relationships among human and non-human actors and their roles to enact new products. We do this to contribute both evidence and theory regarding the concept of a sociotechnical assemblage that serves as the innovation network. Advancing a sociotechnical conceptualization of innovation focuses attention on the contributions of, and linkages among, different types of actors; individuals and organizations, visions and concepts, and technological artifacts and prototypes together create a means for innovation to occur. The empirical basis for this theorizing comes from a detailed study of the community of research scientists, faculty, and graduate students; institutions such as research labs, funding sources, and product companies who were (and mostly still are) involved in tabletop computing. Analysis highlights the centrality of visions, concepts and technological artifacts in the innovation network. We also find that formal organizations play important, but often unrealized, roles in supporting innovation.; Platformic Management, Boundary Resources for Gig Work, and Worker Autonomy -- We advance the concept of platformic management, and the ways in which platforms help to structure project-based or “gig” work. We do so knowing that the popular press and a substantial number of the scholarly publications characterize the “rise of the gig economy” as advancing worker autonomy and flexibility, focusing attention to online digital labor platforms such as Uber and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Scholars have conceptualized the procedures of control exercised by these platforms as exerting “algorithmic management,” reflecting the use of extensive data collection to feed algorithms that structure work. In this paper, we broaden the attention to algorithmic management and gig-working control in two ways. First, we characterize the managerial functions of Upwork, an online platform that facilitates knowledge-intensive freelance labor - to advance discourse beyond ride-sharing and room-renting labor. Second, we advance the concept of platformic management as a means to convey a broader and sociotechnical premise of these platforms’ functions in structuring work. We draw on data collected from Upwork forum discussions, interviews with gig workers who use Upwork, and a walkthrough analysis of the Upwork platform to develop our analysis. Our findings lead us to articulate platformic management -- extending beyond algorithms -- and to present the platform as a “boundary resource” to illustrate the paradoxical affordances of Upwork and similar labor platforms. That is, the platform (1) enables the autonomy desired by gig workers, while (2) also serving as a means of control that helps maintain the viability of transactions and protects the platform from disintermediation.; Social scientists, documents and cyberinfrastructure -- A limited understanding of the distributed work practices of social scientists impedes current efforts to develop cyberinfrastructure (CI) that meets the needs of these scholars. In this paper we review literature on the theory, organization, collaborative practices, and epistemic cultures of the social sciences to summarize fundamental characteristics about the nature of their work practices. Building off these insights, we advance a document-centered articulation of social scientists' distributed work practices derived from a pilot study of scholars in the field of information studies. We use a mixed-methodological approach involving the mapping of digital and physical documents, automated tracking of desktop and online repositories, participant-generated images of physical documents and desktop, behavioral queries, along with interviews and participant observation. Our findings suggest that an approach focused on documents offers a tangible entree into understanding the distributed work practices of social scientists. This study aims to help further discussion surrounding the uptake of CI in the social sciences and the role of academic disciplines in the design of CI tools and projects.; Exploring enterprise social systems & organisational change -- ; Conceptualizing time, space and computing for work and organizing -- Through this article we draw on concepts of time and space to help us theorize on the uses of information and communication technologies in work and for organizing. We do so because many of the contemporary discussions regarding work and organization are usually, and too often implicitly, drawing on rudimentary understandings of these concepts. Our focus here is to advance beyond simplistic articulations and to provide a more conceptually sound approach to address time, space and the uses of information and communication technologies in work. We do this focusing on temporal and spatial relations as a means to depict time and space at work. We characterize work as varying by two characteristics: the degree of interaction and the level of individual autonomy. We then develop a functional view of information and communication technologies relative to their uses for production, control, coordination, access and enjoyment. We conclude by integrating these concepts into an initial framework which allows us to theorize that new forms of work are moving towards four distinct forms of organizing. We further argue that each of these four forms has particular spatial and temporal characteristics that have distinct and different needs for information and communication technologies.; Social informatics of data norms -- Big data has been widely promoted across disciplines and sectors for its potential to enhance lives and promote knowledge discovery. However, challenges arise at all stages of the data lifecycle due to the complexity of interactions between data and the contexts within which they are collected and managed, which has implications for interpretations of this data and eventual use of information and the creation of knowledge products from these data. Starting from the perspective of social informatics, this panel will discuss: the reciprocal relationships between data and context; specific challenges in distinct stages of data generation, data repository implementation, data curation, data use, and data reproducibility; and the implications of these challenges and their potential solutions for both social informatics research and society in general.; The social informatics of knowledge -- In the Introduction to this special issue on the Social Informatics of Knowledge, the editors of the issue reflect on the history of the term “social informatics” and how the articles in this issue both reflect and depart from the original concept. We examine how social informatics researchers have studied knowledge, computerization, and the workplace, and how all of those have evolved over time. We describe the process by which articles were included, how they help us understand the field of social informatics scholarship today, and reflect briefly on what the future of the field holds.; Documenting work -- ; Social scientists and cyberinfrastructure -- Contemporary cyberinfrastructure (CI) seem poorly developed to meet the distributed work practices of social scientists. We draw from the literatures of science studies and e-science practices to advance a document-centered articulation of social scientists' distributed work practices. We report on a pilot study to provide some insights into CI needs for these scholars. This study relied on a mixed-methodological approach involving the mapping of digital and physical documents, automated tracking of desktop and online repositories, participant-generated images of physical documents and desktop, behavioral queries, along with interviews and participant observation. Findings suggest a document perspective provides insight into the distributed work practices and CI uses of social scientists.; Digital assemblages -- We develop the concept of digital assemblages in order to advance current theorising on the ways in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) are helping to reshape work. The empirical setting is the US residential real estate industry-a 'living laboratory' for studying information-intensive work and the adoption and uses of ICT. We find that real estate agents' uses of ICT are pervasive and suggest that agents now embed themselves more deeply into the transacting of real estate by actively supporting buyers and sellers, rather than acting primarily as information intermediaries. Building from this, we theorise that this ICT use can more coherently be understood as a 'digital assemblage' rather than a formal information system. Digital assemblages are characterised as distinct patterns of ICT collections that, in use, are functionally equivalent and structurally similar, relying on standardised and commodified ICT and are neither formally designed nor collectively governed.; Special issue on futures for research on information systems -- ; The social design of information systems -- This panel focuses on issues of designing information systems to both account for, and better support, the increasingly social functions that computer-based tech nologies play. The goal of this panel is to serve as a forum to advance and discuss initial principles for what we are calling the social design of information systems. By social design we mean to emphasize that the presence and uses of information systems play an often significant role in supporting the reshaping social relations, social structures, social boundaries, and social norms. Many such aspects of this reshaping are highlighted in the scholarship of IFIP 8.2 members, and with this panel we seek to focus the collective attention of the assembled scholars to shift attention from (problematizing( the issues with designing information systems toward advancing socially relevant design principles (e.g., Iivari et al. 1998).; Social interactions of information systems development teams -- We report results from a longitudinal study of information systems development (ISD) teams. We use data drawn from 60 ISD teams at 22 sites of 15 Fortune 500 organizations to explore variations in performance relative to these teams social interactions. To do this, we characterize ISD as a form of new product development and focus on team-level social interactions with external stakeholders. Drawing on cluster analysis, we identify five patterns of team-level social interactions and the relationships of these patterns to a suite of objective and subjective measures of ISD performance. Analysis leads us to report three findings. First, data indicate that no one of the five identified patterns maximizes all performance measures. Second, data make clear that the most common approach to ISD is the least effective relative to our suite of performance measures. Third, data from this study show that early indications of ISD project success do not predict actual outcomes. These findings suggest two issues for research and practice. First, these findings indicate that varying patterns of social interactions lead to differences in ISD team performance. Second, the findings illustrate that singular measures of ISD performance are an oversimplification and that multiple measures of ISD performance are unlikely to agree.; U.S. public safety networks -- Through this paper we advance insights regarding common patterns among information and communication technology (ICT) architectures (ICTA) found in United States' public safety networks (PSNs). A PSN is an inter-organizational collaboration enabled by ICT to support information sharing and interoperability needs of police and associated public safety organizations. Substantial evidence makes clear the information systems designed and used by PSNs are typically expensive and complex, support multiple public agencies from different organs of government and span different political and geographic boundaries. Better understanding of PSN ICTA patterns could lead to improved designs and possibly improved performance of these (and perhaps other forms of) multi-agency technology-enabled collaborations. Empirical data from 61 operational PSNs provides the basis for this work. These data were analyzed using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), an approach ideally suited for detailed analyses across smaller data sets that allows us to assess inter-dependence among variables. Results show that (1) functionally similar configuration patterns of ICTA exist among PSNs and (2) several common architectural patterns are associated with higher levels of PSN performance, but these include a large number of unique successful arrangements.; Architectural patterns of U.S. public safety networks -- This paper contains analysis and some initial insights into the patterns of information technology (IT) architecture found in United States' public safety networks (PSNs). A PSN is understood to be an inter-organizational collaboration enabled by IT in support of the information sharing and interoperability needs of police and associated public safety organizations. We know the information systems designed and used by PSNs are often complex, expensive, and must support multiple public safety agencies. Improving our understanding of PSN IT architecture patterns could lead to improved designs and possibly improved performance of PSNs themselves. Data collected on 61 PSNs are analyzed using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). The fsQCA method is explained in detail for those unfamiliar with this technique. Results illuminate (1) functionally similar configuration patterns of IT architecture among PSNs and (2) multiple architectural patterns associated with PSN performance.; Sociotechnical approaches to the study of information systems -- Through this chapter, we introduce and explain the sociotechnical premise relative to the study of information systems (IS). The sociotechnical premise can be articulated as (1) the mutual constitution of people and technologies (and, specifically, digital technologies*), (2) the contextual embeddedness of this mutuality, and (3) the importance of collective action. Some readers will value this chapter for its breadth of coverage. Established sociotechnical scholars will likely thirst for more advanced discussions than what we provide here. Some readers will value the material in this chapter for identifying particular debates, current themes, or emerging approaches. We see this as a special opportunity and focus on these topics at the chapter’s end.; Infrastructural Competence -- ; Advancing Social Informatics -- ; Comparing internal and external interoperability of digital infrastructures -- This research study compares the internal and external interoperability of digital infrastructures across two cyberinfrastructure organizations. Internal interoperability refers to the work that goes into developing seamless relations to align people and resources for a CI provision whereas external interoperability refers to the linkages the CI provision makes to the larger institutional ecology of science. The case study is designed to look at the goverce of digital infrastructures to understand policy decisions in relation to three institutional aspects of science: funding, publication norms, and training and professionalization. Initial findings suggest that internal interoperability is similar for both digital infrastructures whereas external interoperability differs and is shaped by the domain of science that is stewarding the development of the provision. The study concludes by suggesting that linking digital infrastructure development to the components of science practice may be a starting point to understand how they become embedded (or not) in scientific work.; Distancing Bonus Or Downscaling Loss? The Changing Livelihood of Us Online Workers in Times of COVID-19 -- We draw on data from the Online Labour Index and interviews with freelancers in the United States securing work on online platforms, to illuminate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic's global economic upheaval is shuttering shops and offices. Those able to do so are now working remotely from their homes. They join workers who have always been working remotely: freelancers who earn some or all of their income from projects secured via online labour platforms. Data allow us to sketch a first picture of how the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the livelihoods of online freelancers. The data shows online labour demand falling rapidly in early March 2020, but with an equally rapid recovery. We also find significant differences between countries and occupations. Data from interviews make clear jobs are increasingly scarce even as more people are creating profiles and seeking freelance work online.; Intellectual diversity and the faculty composition of iSchools -- We provide evidence and discuss findings regarding the intellectual distribution and faculty composition of academic units involved in the iSchool community. To better understand the intellectual heritage and major influences shaping the development of the individual and collective identities in iSchools, we develop a classification of the intellectual domains of iSchool faculty education. We use this to develop a descriptive analysis of the community's intellectual composition. The discussion focuses on characterizing intellectual diversity in the iSchools. We conclude with a discussion of the potential implications of these trends relative to the future development of the iSchool community.; Documents and distributed scientific collaboration -- We ask the question: What document infrastructures do scientists build to support their virtual organizing and documenting practices? Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is seen by many as playing a critical role in the future of social, behavioral, and economic sciences (SBE) by enabling innovation and scientific discovery. However, little is known about SBE scientists' distributed collaboration, a vital practice that CI must support for the doing of science. To provide insight into this question we interviewed 12 scientists regarding their work practices as they pursue joint research projects with colleagues from other universities. We identify the most frequently used physical and digital tools for SBE science and collaboration and characterize commonplace scientific practices in this domain with a paradigmatic example.\""

       "'Topic modeling for evaluating students\\' reflective writing -- Journal writing is an important and common reflective practice in education. Students\\' reflection journals also offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, the analysis of the textual reflections in class of large size presents challenges. Automatic analysis of students\\' reflective writing holds great promise for providing adaptive real time support for students. This paper proposes a method based on topic modeling techniques for the task of themes exploration and reflection grade prediction. We evaluated this method on a sample of journal writings from pre-service teachers. The topic modeling method was able to discover the important themes and patterns emerged in students\\' reflection journals. Weekly topic relevance and word count were identified as important indicators of their journal grades. Based on the patterns discovered by topic modeling, prediction models were developed to automate the assessing and grading of reflection journals. The findings indicate the potential of topic modeling in serving as an analytic tool for teachers to explore and assess students\\' reflective thoughts in written journals.; Language and ideology in congress -- Legislative speech records from the 101st to 108th Congresses of the US Senate are analysed to study political ideologies. A widely-used text classification algorithm - Support Vector Machines (SVM) - allows the extraction of terms that are most indicative of conservative and liberal positions in legislative speeches and the prediction of senators\\' ideological positions, with a 92 per cent level of accuracy. Feature analysis identifies the terms associated with conservative and liberal ideologies. The results demonstrate that cultural references appear more important than economic references in distinguishing conservative from liberal congressional speeches, calling into question the common economic interpretation of ideological differences in the US Congress.; 3rd International Workshop on news recommendation and analytics (INRA 2015) -- The 3rd International Workshop on News Recommendation and Analytics (INRA 2015) is held in conjunction with RecSys 2015 Conference in Vienna, Austria. This paper presents a brief summary of the INRA 2015. This workshop aims to create an interdisciplinary community that addresses design issues in news recommender systems and news analytics, and promote fruitful collaboration opportunities between researchers, media companies and practitioners. We have a keynote speaker and an invited demo presentation in addition to 4 papers accepted in this workshop.; Documenting business-to-consumer (B2C) communications on facebook -- Purpose – The purpose of this study is to document how restaurant’s business-to-consumer communication strategies evolved on Facebook over time and how consumers’ reactions to a variety of Facebook messages changed over time. Design/methodology/approach – This study analyzed 2,463 Facebook messages posted by seven quick-service restaurant chains and three casual-dining restaurant chains in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2012 and 2014. ANOVA and post hoc t-test were used to compare the differences among four media types (photo, status update, video and hyperlink) in terms of their usage by companies and Facebook users’ reactions to these messages (measured by number of “Likes”, number of comments and number of shares). Findings – Over the three periods of time under observation, there is a substantial decrease of status updates by restaurants and a dramatic increase of photo updates. Photo remained as the most “popular” media type, receiving most “Likes”, comments and shares from consumers. Video was not considered “popular” in 2010 but experienced a slight increase in usage and slowly emerged in 2012 and 2014 as another “popular” media, which no longer had statistical difference with photo in number of comments and shares. Research limitations/implications – Some limitations include an under representable sample and its longitudinal design, but the fndings provide additional insight to current literature in social media. Practical implications – A series of suggestions were advanced from the fndings to help hospitality managers better engage Facebook users. Originality/value – This is probably the frst time-series or longitudinal-like analysis in social media research and yields meaningful fndings.; Exploring the relationship between mood and creativity in rock lyrics -- The relationship between mood and creativity has been widely studied in psychology, however, no conclusion is reached in terms of which mood triggers high creativity, positive or negative. This paper provides new insights to this on-going argument by examining the relationship between lyrics creativity and music mood. We use three computational measures to gauge lyrics creativity: Type-to- Token Ratio, word norms fraction, and WordNet similarity. We then test three hypotheses regarding differences in lyrics creativity between music with different moods on 2715 U.S. rock songs. The three measures led to consistent findings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate higher linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs. Our findings support previous studies in psycholinguistics that people write more creatively when the text conveys sad or negative sentiment, and contradict previous research that positive mood triggers more unusual word associations. The result also indicates that different measures capture different aspects of lyrics creativity.; Teaching information science and technology to the world? Practices, challenges and visions -- Information science and technology (IST) has made unprecedented impacts on society. Teaching IST should by no means be limited within the boundary of the discipline. Based on their experiences in teaching IST in various levels, speakers in this panel will reflect the past, share current practices and envision the future of teaching IST to the world. Collectively we aim to stimulate further discussions on increasing the impact of the field through education.; Spreading Social Media Messages on Facebook -- As a method of determining what types of social media messages work best for hospitality firms, this study examined what types of messages gained the most clicks of \"Like\" and comments on Facebook. An analysis of the number of likes and comments regarding nine hundred and eighty-two Facebook messages from ten restaurant chains and two independent operators revealed clear patterns. The more popular keywords involved information about the restaurant (e.g., menu descriptions) and the less popular messages were those that contained marketing-related words (including \"winner\" and \"check\"). Dividing the messages into four media types, namely, status (text only), link (containing a URL), video (embedding a video), and photo (showing photos), revealed that photo and status receive more likes and comments than the other two categories. Social media messages can also be categorized into two message types: sales and marketing (about two-thirds of the messages in this study) and conversational messages. Based on number of likes and comments, conversational messages are endorsed by more Facebook users. Finally, cross-effects of media type and message type affect the number of comments a message received. Although these results do not expressly assess Facebook users\\' reactions, the guidelines developed here should help managers improve their use of Facebook, as well as provide groundwork for developing a defined typology of Facebook messages and an automatic text classifier with the machine learning techniques.; Taxonomy of Facebook messages in business-to-consumer communications -- This research combines machine learning and human intelligence to analyze 2654 Facebook messages initiated by 26 hospitality companies to develop the taxonomy of Facebook messages in business-toconsumer (B2C) communications. Facebook messages can be classified into two broad message types: Sales/Marketing messages, with five sub-categories of Social Responsibility, Direct Boasting, Indirect Boasting, Product Highlight, and Campaign/Sales, and Conversational messages, with four sub-categories of Call for Action, Provoke Feedback, Advice/Suggestions, and Updates. By comparison, Conversational messages received more \"Likes\" and comments than Sales/Marketing messages. Direct Boasting, Product Highlight, Call for Action, Provoke Feedback, Advice/Suggestions, and Updates received more \"Likes\" than other types; Provoke Feedback and Call for Action received more comments. As compared to current literature, the results allow managers to advance more specific strategies to better engage with Facebook users and provide a more thorough taxonomy for additional analysis on companies\\' B2C messages on other social media websites.; The 7 Ps marketing mix of home-sharing services -- The 7 Ps model is a very useful tool in helping service firms solve managerial issues in marketing. Guided by the 7 Ps marketing mix framework, a big-data, supervised machine learning analysis was performed with 1,148,062 English reviews of 37,092 Airbnb listings in San Francisco and New York City. The results disclose similar patterns in both markets, where travelers shared their experience about Service Product and Physical Evidence most often; Price and Promotion were the least mentioned elements. Furthermore, through a series of comparisons of Airbnb\\'s 7 Ps marketing mix among the listings managed by different types of hosts, multi-unit and single-unit hosts seem to offer similar services with a small observable difference; whereas superhosts and the ordinary hosts deliver different services. This study makes valuable methodological contributions and provides practical marketing insights for hoteliers and the hosts and webmasters on home-sharing websites. Policymakers should pay special attention to multi-unit hosts.; Identifying Finding Sentences in Conclusion Subsections of Biomedical Abstracts -- Segmenting scientific abstracts and full-text based on their rhetorical function is an essential task in text classification. Small rhetorical segments can be useful for fine-grained literature search, summarization, and comparison. Current effort has been focusing on segmenting documents into general sections such as introduction, method, and conclusion, and much less on the roles of individual sentences within the segments. For example, not all sentences in the conclusion section are describing research findings. In this work, we developed rule-based and machine learning methods and compared their performance in identifying the finding sentences in conclusion subsections of biomedical abstracts. 1100 conclusion subsections with observational and randomized clinical trials study designs covering five common health topics were sampled from PubMed to develop and evaluate the methods. The rule-based method and the bag-of-words based machine learning method both achieved high accuracy. The better performance by the simple rule-based approach shows that although advanced machine learning approaches could capture the main patterns, human expert may still outperform on such a specialized task.; Interventions to support consumer evaluation of online health information credibility -- Purpose: Various interventions have been designed to help consumers better evaluate the credibility of online health information (OHI). However, assessing information credibility remained the most widely reported challenge by online health consumers. This review aims to provide an overview of major intervention approaches for improving consumer ability to evaluate OHI credibility in order to identify opportunities for future interventions. Methods: A scoping review was performed. Seven relevant scientific databases were searched to identify articles that report the design and/or evaluation of interventions to support, facilitate, or assist consumers in assessing the credibility of OHI. Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. Relevant content was extracted from the articles and all codes were validated by second coders. Results: Three major intervention approaches for enhancing consumers\\' ability to evaluate OHI credibility were identified: educational program, algorithm, and interactive interface. The design of most interventions (particularly the credibility evaluation component) lacked the guidance of theories, and very few studies systematically evaluated their effectiveness in real online search contexts. Few interventions can provide spontaneous support to consumers while they search online. Conclusion: Our understanding of what theoretical constructs contribute to effective OHI credibility evaluation interventions and how intervention outcomes should be measured remained limited. Future efforts need to focus on the design, development, test, and evaluation of theory-guided OHI credibility evaluation interventions that are scalable, sustainable, and can provide real-time support to consumers.; Collecting representative pictures for words -- This poster proposes a human computation approach to collecting representative pictures for words so that the collected pictures can efficiently and effectively convey the meaning of the words or concepts. A large collection of representative pictures can be used in text-to-picture communication systems, and may also be used to teach computers to learn what representative pictures are. We have developed a web application to help players of Draw Something, a popular social mobile game, search pictures for drawing inspiration while at the same time they implicitly help us collect representative pictures for words. Our preliminary result shows that the proposed approach has the potential to harvest Draw Something players for collecting desired data.; Sentence recall game -- Recently we ran a simple memory test experiment, called sentence recall, in which participants were asked to recall sentences that they had just seen on the screen. Many participants, especially non-native English speakers, made various deviations in their recalled sentences. Some deviations represent alternative ways to express the same meaning, but others suggest that there are missing pieces in the participants\\' language knowledge. The deviation data, on the one hand, can provide individual users valuable feedback on their language usage patterns that they may never notice, on the other hand, can be used as training data for automatically discovering language usage patterns in a subpopulation of language learners. This paper presents our attempts to create an enjoyable sentence recall game for collecting a large amount of deviation data. Our results show that the game is fun to play and the collected deviation data can reveal common language usage patterns among non-native speakers.; Toward predicting popularity of social marketing messages -- Popularity of social marketing messages indicates the effectiveness of the corresponding marketing strategies. This research aims to discover the characteristics of social marketing messages that contribute to different level of popularity. Using messages posted by a sample of restaurants on Facebook as a case study, we measured the message popularity by the number of \"likes\" voted by fans, and examined the relationship between the message popularity and two properties of the messages: (1) content, and (2) media type. Combining a number of text mining and statistics methods, we have discovered some interesting patterns correlated to \"more popular\" and \"less popular\" social marketing messages. This work lays foundation for building computational models to predict the popularity of social marketing messages in the future.; Collecting legacy corpora from social science research for text mining evaluation -- In this poster we describe a pilot study of searching social science literature for legacy corpora to evaluate text mining algorithms. The new emerging field of computational social science demands large amount of social science data to train and evaluate computational models. We argue that the legacy corpora that were annotated by social science researchers through traditional Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) are ideal data sets to evaluate text mining methods, such as text categorization and clustering. As a pilot study, we searched articles that involve content analysis and discourse analysis in leading communication journals, and then contacted the authors regarding the availability of the annotated texts. Regretfully, nearly all of the corpora that we found were not adequately maintained, and many were no longer available, even though they were less than ten years old. This situation calls for more effort to better maintain and use legacy social science data for future computational social science research purpose.; Crowdsourcing participatory evaluation of medical pictograms using amazon mechanical turk -- Background: Consumer and patient participation proved to be an effective approach for medical pictogram design, but it can be costly and time-consuming. We proposed and evaluated an inexpensive approach that crowdsourced the pictogram evaluation task to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers, who are usually referred to as the \"turkers\". Objective: To answer two research questions: (1) Is the turkers\\' collective effort effective for identifying design problems in medical pictograms? and (2) Do the turkers\\' demographic characteristics affect their performance in medical pictogram comprehension? Methods: We designed a Web-based survey (open-ended tests) to ask 100 US turkers to type in their guesses of the meaning of 20 US pharmacopeial pictograms. Two judges independently coded the turkers\\' guesses into four categories: correct, partially correct, wrong, and completely wrong. The comprehensibility of a pictogram was measured by the percentage of correct guesses, with each partially correct guess counted as 0.5 correct. We then conducted a content analysis on the turkers\\' interpretations to identify misunderstandings and assess whether the misunderstandings were common. We also conducted a statistical analysis to examine the relationship between turkers\\' demographic characteristics and their pictogram comprehension performance. Results: The survey was completed within 3 days of our posting the task to the MTurk, and the collected data are publicly available in the multimedia appendix for download. The comprehensibility for the 20 tested pictograms ranged from 45% to 98%, with an average of 72.5%. The comprehensibility scores of 10 pictograms were strongly correlated to the scores of the same pictograms reported in another study that used oral response-based open-ended testing with local people. The turkers\\' misinterpretations shared common errors that exposed design problems in the pictograms. Participant performance was positively correlated with their educational level. Conclusions: The results confirmed that crowdsourcing can be used as an effective and inexpensive approach for participatory evaluation of medical pictograms. Through Web-based open-ended testing, the crowd can effectively identify problems in pictogram designs. The results also confirmed that education has a significant effect on the comprehension of medical pictograms. Since low-literate people are underrepresented in the turker population, further investigation is needed to examine to what extent turkers\\' misunderstandings overlap with those elicited from low-literate people.; Language and gender in congressional speech -- This study draws from a large corpus of Congressional speeches from the 101st to the 110th Congress (1989-2008), to examine gender differences in language use in a setting of political debates. Female legislators\\' speeches demonstrated characteristics of both a feminine language style (e.g. more use of emotion words, fewer articles) and a masculine one (e.g. more nouns and long words, fewer personal pronouns). A trend analysis found that these gender differences have consistently existed in the Congressional speeches over the past 20 years, regardless of the topic of debate. The findings lend support to the argument that gender differences in language use persist in professional settings like the floor of Congress.; The emotional world of health online communities -- This article presents a preliminary study on the emotional world of health online communities. Using sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques, this study aims to (1) examine the strength of various kinds of emotions (positivity, optimism, negativity, anxiety, anger, and sadness) in online health forum discussions, and (2) compare the emotional status and expression of forum participants under different roles, such as askers and answerers, men and women, and caregivers and patients. This study is expected to improve the understanding of the emotional communication in online health communities.; Automated citation sentiment analysis -- Automated citation sentiment analysis is a newly emerged research topic inspired by traditional citation context analysis in scientometrics and applied linguistics. The main goals of current citation sentiment analysis are to develop new tools to model scientific literature and provide authoring support for researchers in tasks like literature review. In terms of developing authoring support tools, however, current studies have not taken into consideration the behavioral patterns of researchers\\' literature review practice, leaving user need assessment as a missing piece in current interdisciplinary research effort. This paper analyzed biomedical researchers\\' need by reviewing their publications on using manual citation sentiment analysis for detecting citation bias, and discussed the differences between biomedical researchers\\' approach and current automated citation sentiment analysis model. These differences are expected to inform the modeling of automated citation sentiment analysis.; Auto-tracking controversial topics in social-media-based customer dialog -- This study proposed and validated a topic modeling-based approach for auto-tracking customer dialog on social media, using Starbucks as a case study because of its pioneering social media practice in service industry. A topic model was fit based on nearly 150,000 customer comments posted to Starbucks’ Facebook page in 2013. This model was able to identify not only business-related topics, such as customer responses to marketing campaigns, but also controversial topics regarding community involvement and corporate social responsibility, such as gay, gun, and government. Guided by this topic model, each topic’s evolving dynamics and patterns of user participation were further revealed, providing a bird’s-eye view of the topics and their evolution. The case study has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively track the main themes in the customer dialog on social media, zoom in on the controversial topics, measure their time spans, and locate the participants and the vocal activists. Such information would be valuable input for companies to design their intervention strategies and evaluate the outcomes in social media discussions.; Detecting causal language use in science findings -- Causal interpretation of correlational findings from observational studies has been a major type of misinformation in science communication. Prior studies on identifying inappropriate use of causal language relied on manual content analysis, which is not scalable for examining a large volume of science publications. In this study, we first annotated a corpus of over 3,000 PubMed research conclusion sentences, then developed a BERT-based prediction model that classifies conclusion sentences into “no relationship”, “correlational”, “conditional causal”, and “direct causal” categories, achieving an accuracy of 0.90 and a macroF1 of 0.88. We then applied the prediction model to measure the causal language use in the research conclusions of about 38,000 observational studies in PubMed. The prediction result shows that 21.7% studies used direct causal language exclusively in their conclusions, and 32.4% used some direct causal language. We also found that the ratio of causal language use differs among authors from different countries, challenging the notion of a shared consensus on causal language use in the global science community. Our prediction model could also be used to help identify the inappropriate use of causal language in science publications.; Measuring Correlation-to-Causation Exaggeration in Press Releases -- Press releases have an increasingly strong influence on media coverage of health research; however, they have been found to contain seriously exaggerated claims that can misinform the public and undermine public trust in science. In this study we propose an NLP approach to identify exaggerated causal claims made in health press releases that report on observational studies, which are designed to establish correlational findings, but are often exaggerated as causal. We developed a new corpus and trained models that can identify causal claims in the main statements in a press release. By comparing the claims made in a press release with the corresponding claims in the original research paper, we found that 22% of press releases made exaggerated causal claims from correlational findings in observational studies. Furthermore, universities exaggerated more often than journal publishers by a ratio of 1.5 to 1. Encouragingly, the exaggeration rate has slightly decreased over the past 10 years, despite the increase of the total number of press releases. More research is needed to understand the cause of the decreasing pattern.; HClaimE -- This study tackles the problem of extracting health claims from health research news headlines, in order to carry out veracity check. A health claim can be formally defined as a triplet consisting of an independent variable (IV – namely, what is being manipulated), a dependent variable (DV – namely, what is being measured), and the relation between the two. In this study, we develop HClaimE, an information extraction tool for identifying health claims in news headlines. Unlike the existing open information extraction (OpenIE) systems that rely on verbs as relation indicators, HClaimE focuses on finding relations between nouns, and draws on the linguistic characteristics of news headlines. HClaimE uses a Naïve Bayes classifier that combines syntactic and lexical features for identifying IV and DV nouns, and recognizes relations between IV and DV through a rule-based method. We conducted an evaluation on a set of health news headlines from ScienceDaily.com, and the results show that HClaimE outperforms current OpenIE systems: the F-measures for identifying headlines without health claims is 0.60 and that for extracting IV-relation-DV is 0.69. Our study shows that nouns can provide more clues than verbs for identifying health claims in news headlines. Furthermore, it also shows that dependency relations and bag-of-words can distinguish IV-DV noun pairs from other noun pairs. In practice, HClaimE can be used as a helpful tool to identifying health claims in news headlines, which can then be further compared against authoritative health claims for veracity. Given the linguistic similarity between health claims and other causal claims, e.g., impacts of pollution on the environment, HClaimE may also be applicable for extracting claims in other domains.; Information quality of reddit link posts on health news -- Inaccuracy has been a common problem in news coverage of scientific research. This problem has been particularly prevalent in health research news. Health research news usually spreads from research publications and press releases to news and social media. In this study we examined the information quality of the Reddit link posts that introduce health news stories. We developed a coding schema to annotate the inaccurate information in a sample of 250 link posts on health research news within the Reddit community r/Health in 2018. The result shows that most link posts simply copied the original news headlines verbatim, while some paraphrased the news stories by adding, deleting, replacing, and combining content. We found that 12 paraphrased link posts contained inaccurate information that may mislead the readers. The most common type of inaccuracy is exaggeration resulted from changing the original speculative claims to direct causal statements by removing the modal verbs such as “may” and “might”. The result shows that although the link posts of health news were generally faithful to the original news stories, exaggerated claims may lead to false hope for researchers and patients.'"

      "Incorporating Values Sensitive Design into Crowdsourcing Methodologies for Knowledge Collaboration -- In recent years, we have seen a dramatic increase in crowdsourcing approaches to solve problems and engage in other types of knowledge work in many domains, including genetics, health, cultural heritage, digital preservation and design. Crowdsourcing initiatives offer many potential benefits, including engaging individuals of diverse backgrounds in collaborative meaning-making and production. And yet, the potential challenges and dangers, such as issues related to quality and false confidence, can hardly escape our attention. This panel will explore how human-centered approaches to crowdsourcing can help minimize its challenges. In particular, this panel will ask how we implement crowdsourcing methods, what our outcomes should be, and how we should go about developing and defining our outcomes in relationship to the workers. The first half of the session will be devoted to an introduction to crowdsourcing initiatives and associated critical issues. Each presentation will drill progressively deeper into the mechanisms and implications of crowdsourcing. In the second half of the session, we invite session attendees to engage with us in a collaborative activity employing techniques from the value sensitive design approach to design crowdsourcing initiatives that are sensitive to the communities with whom we engage and thereby endeavor to realize humanistic goals. It is our hope that the panel session will result in new collaborations and spark the development of more thoughtful, reflexive and productive crowdsourcing activities.; Twitter Users’ Privacy Concerns: What do Their Accounts’ First Names Tell Us? -- ; Twitter users' privacy concerns -- Purpose: In this paper, we describe how gender recognition on Twitter can be used as an intelligent business tool to determine the privacy concerns among users, and ultimately offer a more personalized service for customers who are more likely to respond positively to targeted advertisements. Design/methodology/approach: We worked with two different data sets to examine whether Twitter users' gender, inferred from the first name of the account and the profile description, correlates with the privacy setting of the account. We also used a set of features including the inferred gender of Twitter users to develop classifiers that predict user privacy settings. Findings: We found that the inferred gender of Twitter users correlates with the account's privacy setting. Specifically, females tend to be more privacy concerned than males. Users whose gender cannot be inferred from their provided first names tend to be more privacy concerned. In addition, our classification performance suggests that inferred gender can be used as an indicator of the user's privacy preference. Research limitations: It is known that not all twitter accounts are real user accounts, and social bots tweet as well. A major limitation of our study is the lack of consideration of social bots in the data. In our study, this implies that at least some percentage of the undefined accounts, that is, accounts that had names non-existent in the name dictionary, are social bots. It will be interesting to explore the privacy setting of social bots in the Twitter space. Practical implications: Companies are investing large amounts of money in business intelligence tools that allow them to know the preferences of their consumers. Due to the large number of consumers around the world, it is very difficult for companies to have direct communication with each customer to anticipate market changes. For this reason, the social network Twitter has gained relevance as one ideal tool for information extraction. On the other hand, users' privacy preference needs to be considered when companies consider leveraging their publicly available data. This paper suggests that gender recognition of Twitter users, based on Twitter users' provided first names and their profile descriptions, can be used to infer the users' privacy preference. Originality/value: This study explored a new way of inferring Twitter user's gender, that is, to recognize the user's gender based on the provided first name and the user's profile description. The potential of this information for predicting the user's privacy preference is explored.; Multi-channel convolutional neural network for twitter emotion and sentiment recognition -- The advent of micro-blogging sites has paved the way for researchers to collect and analyze huge volumes of data in recent years. Twitter, being one of the leading social networking sites worldwide, provides a great opportunity to its users for expressing their states of mind via short messages which are called tweets. The urgency of identifying emotions and sentiments conveyed through tweets has led to several research works. It provides a great way to understand human psychology and impose a challenge to researchers to analyze their content easily. In this paper, we propose a novel use of a multi-channel convolutional neural architecture which can effectively use different emotion and sentiment indicators such as hashtags, emoticons and emojis that are present in the tweets and improve the performance of emotion and sentiment identification. We also investigate the incorporation of different lexical features in the neural network model and its effect on the emotion and sentiment identification task. We analyze our model on some standard datasets and compare its effectiveness with existing techniques.; A lexicon-based approach for detecting hedges in informal text -- Hedging is a commonly used strategy in conversational management to show the speaker's lack of commitment to what they communicate, which may signal problems between the speakers. Our project is interested in examining the presence of hedging words and phrases in identifying the tension between an interviewer and interviewee during a survivor interview. While there have been studies on hedging detection in the natural language processing literature, all existing work has focused on structured texts and formal communications. Our project thus investigated a corpus of eight unstructured conversational interviews about the Rwanda Genocide and identified hedging patterns in the interviewees' responses. Our work produced three manually constructed lists of hedge words, booster words, and hedging phrases. Leveraging these lexicons, we developed a rule-based algorithm that detects sentence-level hedges in informal conversations such as survivor interviews. Our work also produced a dataset of 3000 sentences having the categories Hedge and Non-hedge annotated by three researchers. With experiments on this annotated dataset, we verify the efficacy of our proposed algorithm. Our work contributes to the further development of tools that identify hedges from informal conversations and discussions.; What's in the content of Wikipedia's article for deletion discussions? -- As a successful decentralized online peer production system, Wikipedia has a large number of users participating in self-assigned tasks based on their interest. Participants often coordinate on the tasks about editing an article through the article's talk page discussions. Researchers analyze Wikipedia talk page discussions for various aspects such as coordination [13], conflict management [1], emotion [8], leadership [12], the relationship between Wikipedia article's talk page discussion and the article editing activity [5], etc.; Understanding Privacy Dichotomy in Twitter -- ; Writing to Persuade: Analysis and Detection of Persuasive Discourse -- ; Syrapropa at semeval-2020 task 11 -- This paper describes the BERT-based models proposed for two subtasks in SemEval-2020 Task 11: Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles. We first build the model for Span Identification (SI) based on SpanBERT, and facilitate the detection by a deeper model and a sentence-level representation. We then develop a hybrid model for the Technique Classification (TC). The hybrid model is composed of three submodels including two BERT models with different training methods, and a feature-based Logistic Regression model. We endeavor to deal with imbalanced dataset by adjusting cost function. We are in the seventh place in SI subtask (0.4711 of F1-measure), and in the third place in TC subtask (0.6783 of F1-measure) on the development set.; Characterizing susceptible users on Reddit's changemyview -- In the study of persuasion, little attention is paid to understanding features that indicate one's level of susceptibility. In this work, we examine features that are indicative of an individual's susceptibility on Reddit's changemyview. Specifically, we explore attributes about the author of the post, the interactions between an author and other users, and the author's language style.We first categorize authors of posts on changemyview into two groups: susceptible and non-susceptible. We perform a test of significance on different features between susceptible and non-susceptible authors. Experiments showed that an individual's language style can be indicative of one's susceptibility to a change of opinion. Also, an author's prior position on a subject and their way of interacting with other users can indicate the likelihood of an author having an opinion change.; Characterizing the Evolution of Communities on Reddit -- One of the most important structures in social networks is communities. Communities in social networks evolve over time. Understanding the evolution of communities is useful in many applications, such as building successful communities, maintaining the success of communities, etc. There have been some works on studying online communities such as understanding the life cycle of users and understanding the loyalty of members in a community. An aspect of online community studies that has not been sufficiently studied is the evolution of communities over time. In this work, we investigate factors that significantly differentiate the different parts of the evolution of communities. Firstly, we identify the different patterns that can exist in the evolution of communities. Next, we examine how different features differentiate parts of the patterns identified. Experimental results showed that the linguistic style of users who make posts and the interaction dynamics of members in a community are related to different parts of communities' evolution with respect to the number of active users.; Needs assessment of ASIS&T publications -- This study reports the results of a 2016 online survey on perceptions and uses of ASIS&T publications. The 190 survey respondents represented 26 countries and 5 continents, with 77% of participants coming from academia rather than practitioners. Among the emerging themes were calls for a wider scope of research from information science to be reflected in the publications (including JASIS&T and the ASIS&T Proceedings), and ongoing challenges in the role of the Bulletin as a bridge between research and practice. The study provides insights into the scholarly publishing practices of the ASIS&T community and highlights key issues for the future direction of ASIS&T's scholarly communication.; CKM -- Our access to human rights violation data has increased with the growing number and size of data collections. We have been combining text-mining and visualization techniques to facilitate big data analysis in human rights research. Taking a user-centered approach, we first surveyed the human rights research literature to understand reported data analysis practices in the field, and then taking a participatory design approach working with oral history researchers to develop a visual analytical tool that facilitates the analysis of collections of audio-video interviews oral history research projects. In this paper we present our current prototype - Clock-based Keyphrase Map (CKM). CKM utilizes Keyphrase technique to identify important topics in the collection and a clock-based visualization to present them in a temporal order. CKM also enables the users to further analyze the collections and share their analysis process with other researchers. We discuss the tool in details including its architecture, the computational and visualization techniques, and the interaction features. Our future plan on evaluation and further development are also discussed in the paper.; Toward the Automated Detection of Individuals’ Rationales in Large-Scale Online Open Participative Activities -- In large-scale online open participative (LSOOP) activities, participants can join and leave at any time, and they often do not have a history of working together. Although the communication history is usually accessible to the participants in the environment, it is time consuming for them to process the communication data because of the large volume of messages. These characteristics make it difficult for one to keep track of, identify, and interpret the others’ ideas, opinions, and their rationales in LSOOP activities. We argue for a computational approach that automatically identifies and extracts the rationales from LSOOP communication data and presents them to the participants through rationale-based awareness tools. In this paper we bring together different and hitherto independent lines of research, and propose to use them in a conceptual framework integrating three analytical aspects related to the detection of rationales: linguistic, informational, and argumentative and communicative. We also review the design effort on offering rationale-based awareness in the LSOOP activities.; Discourse relations in rationale-containing text-segments -- Offering one's perspective and justifying it has become a common practice in online text-based communications, just as it is in typical, face-to-face communication. Compared to the face-to-face communications, it can be particularly more challenging for users to understand and evaluate another's perspective in online communications. On the other hand, the availability of the communication record in online communications offers a potential to leverage computational techniques to automatically detect user opinions and rationales. One promising approach to automatically detect the rationales is to detect the common discourse relations in rationale texts. However, no empirical work has been done with regard to which discourse relations are commonly present in the users’ rationales in online communications. To fill this gap, we annotated the discourse relations in the text segments that contain the rationales (N = 527 text segments). These text segments are obtained from five datasets that consist of five online posts and the first 100 comments. We identified 10 discourse relations that are commonly present in this sample. Our finding marks an important contribution to this rationale detection approach. We encourage more empirical work, preferably with a larger sample, to examine the generalizability of our findings.; A Message’s Persuasive Features in Wikipedia’s Article for Deletion Discussions -- ; Online Persuasion Mechanisms and Processes – A Research Agenda -- ; Sentiments in wikipedia articles for deletion discussions -- Wikipedia provides a discussion forum, namely, Article for Deletion forum, for people to deliberate about whether or not an article should be deleted from the site. In this paper, we present interesting correlation between outcomes of the discussion and number of sentiments in the comments with different intensity. We performed sentiment analysis on 37,761 AfD discussions with 156,415 top-level comments and explored relationship between outcomes of the discussion and sentiments in the comments. Our preliminary work suggests: discussion that have keep or other outcomes have more than expected positive sentiment, whereas discussions that have delete outcomes have more than expected negative and neutral sentiment. This result shows that there tends to be positive sentiment in the comment when Wikipedia users suggest not to delete the article. This observation of differences in sentiments also encourages to further study influence of sentiments in decision making or outcome of the discussions. Our future analysis will include threaded comments, and examine the relationship between a discussion’s sentiment and its other properties such as topic of the article and the characteristics of the participating users.; Authority Claim in Rationale-Containing Online Comments -- We examined whether the existence of authority claims signifies one’s rationales in online communication content, potentially contributing to the research on rationale identification and rationale generation. Authority claims are statements that reveal the writer’s intention to bolster the writer’s credibility. In open online communications, the anonymity and the dynamic participation make it challenging to establish the credibility of their viewpoints and reasoning. Therefore, we hypothesize these online participants will tend to use authority claims to bolster their credibility when presenting their justifications. We annotated authority claims in 271 text segments that contain online users’ rationales. These text segments are adapted from the open access corpora provided by Rutgers’ Argument Mining group. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that in our dataset the users scarcely attempted to bolster their credibility when presenting their reasoning to the others in these activities. We call for more investigations to explore the role of activity context affects participants’ use of authority claims in their reasoning traces. We further state that the effects of communication medium on individuals’ cognitive and meta-cognitive processes are important to consider in argument mining research.; Changing others' beliefs online -- Achieving social welfare and success is heavily reliant on our ability to persuade and influence others, yet this capacity is known to be one of the most challenging social skills to develop and possess. With social networking websites becoming a crucial platform for routine social activities, gaining insight into the strategies and mechanisms behind online persuasion is of great interest and value to a variety of disciplines. Hence, in this study, we aim to study written comments in online deliberations and understand what makes people change their beliefs. We explore different dimensions of the language, the order of the comments, as well as the attributes of the participating users and their relation to the persuasion process. In addition, we investigate the factors that persuaded users (the ones who have already changed their beliefs) perceived to be the reasons that led to their opinion change. We link our findings to earlier research on persuasion and belief change in traditional forms, hoping to uncover when and how they apply to online persuasion.; Misinformation in the chinese weibo -- Social media users are increasingly influenced by misinformation and disinformation as the techniques offer affordances to rapidly spread information to large groups of people. Most of the existing studies about misinformation and disinformation are in the context of Western cultures, the influence of misinformation in Chinese context is underexplored. To fill this research gap, this study analyzed 26,138 Weibo posts that are marked as containing misinformation. We performed a frequency analysis of these posts’ metadata and the top 50 frequent nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the dataset, and examined the sentiment in the content. Our results show that many posts that contain misinformation tactically target topics that Chinese people are already concerned about. The persuasion literature implies that these characteristics increase the persuasive power of the posts. With the forward-asking verbs are frequently used in the posts, one behavior that the receivers are persuaded to perform is to share these posts with the others, which can contribute to the virality of the misinformation. Another alarming finding is that a large proportion of our collected posts asked the receivers for help and the posts showed gratitude to acknowledge the forwarding and helping behavior. Based on the trust literature and the notion that trust as a social reality, we discuss the potentially severe negative impact these posts can impose on the society as they undermine Weibo users’ trustfulness to others and to the social media platform.; TV-AfD -- In this study, we created an imperative corpus with speech conversations from dialogues in The Big Bang Theory and with the written comments in Wikipedia's Articles for Deletion discussions. For the TV show data, 59 episodes containing 25,076 statements are used. We manually annotated imperatives based on the annotation guideline adapted from Condoravdi and Lauer's study (2012) and used the retrieved data to assess the performance of syntax-based classification rules. For the Wikipedia AfD comments data, we first developed and leveraged a syntax-based classifier to extract 10,624 statements that may be imperative, and we manually examined the statements and then identified true positives. With this corpus, we also examined the performance of the rule-based imperative detection tool. Our result shows different outcomes for speech (dialogue) and written data. The rule-based classification performs better in the written data in precision (0.80) compared to the speech data (0.44). Also, the rule-based classification has a low-performance overall for speech data with the precision of 0.44, recall of 0.41, and f-1 measure of 0.42. This finding implies the syntax-based model may need to be adjusted for a speech dataset because imperatives in oral communication have greater syntactic varieties and are highly context-dependent.; CEW-DTW: A New Time Series Model For Text Mining -- ; CEW-DTW -- The keyword information is usually applied to describe answers. In most of the previous studies, researchers usually rank answers according to keyword retrieval, which fails to consider the importance of the time sequence of keywords in answers. In this paper, we propose CEW-DTW, a new time series model for answer ranking. This model considers the importance of the time sequence of keywords as well as the amount of keywords. CEW-DTW is developed from a carefully designed model, Dynamic Time Warping-Delta (DTW-D). We choose Amazon question/answer data as our evaluation dataset. We apply Entropy to remove noise in answer vectors. In experiments, we apply normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) as the assess rule to test models. CEW-DTW is proven to have a better performance than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Dynamic Time Warping-Delta (DTW-D) in answer ranking. An extensive set of evaluation results demonstrates the effectiveness of the CEW-DTW model for answer ranking.; Augmented Tension Detection in Communication -- Tension in communication often prevents effective flows of information among members in the conversation and thus can negatively influence practices in teams and learning efficiency at school. Interested in developing a computational technique that automatically detects tension in communication, we explore features that signal the existence of tension in human-human communications and investigate the potential of a supervised learning approach. While there is no tension-annotated dataset available, there are language resources that have distress annotated. Although tension may occur during the communication as a result of various factors, distress creates discomfort and tension. Leveraging an interview dataset that has marked the presence/absence of distress, we investigated the prosodic features and LIWC features that indicate tension. Specifically, we compare 23 prosodic features and LIWC features extracted from 186 interviews in terms of how effective they are to indicate the speaker’s distress in a one-to-one conversation. Our analysis shows that there are seven prosodic features and one LIWC features that differ between distress and non-distress interviews. The seven prosodic features are mean intensity, jitter, shimmer, longest silence duration, longest silence position, standard deviation of interviewee speaking rate, and hesitation. And the one effective LIWC feature is health.; The effect of prediscussion note-taking in hidden profile tasks -- Prior research has discovered that groups tend to discuss shared information while failing to discuss unique information in decision-making processes. In our study, we conducted a lab experiment to examine the effect of prediscussion note-taking on this phenomenon. The experiment used a murder-mystery hidden profile task. In all, 192 undergraduate students were recruited and randomly assigned into 48 four-person groups with gender being the matching variable (i.e., each group consisted of four same-gender participants). During the decision-making processes, some groups were asked to take notes while reading task materials and had their notes available in the following group discussion, while the other groups were not given this opportunity. Our analysis results suggest that (a) the presence of an information piece in group members' notes positively correlates with its appearance in the subsequent discussion and note-taking positively affects the group's information repetition rate; (b) group decision quality positively correlates with the group's information sampling rate and negatively correlates with the group's information sampling/repetition bias; and (c) gender has no statistically significant moderating effect on the relationship between note-taking and information sharing. These results imply that prediscussion note-taking could facilitate information sharing but could not alleviate the biased information pooling in hidden profile tasks.\n",

       "'Topic modeling for evaluating students\\' reflective writing -- Journal writing is an important and common reflective practice in education. Students\\' reflection journals also offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, the analysis of the textual reflections in class of large size presents challenges. Automatic analysis of students\\' reflective writing holds great promise for providing adaptive real time support for students. This paper proposes a method based on topic modeling techniques for the task of themes exploration and reflection grade prediction. We evaluated this method on a sample of journal writings from pre-service teachers. The topic modeling method was able to discover the important themes and patterns emerged in students\\' reflection journals. Weekly topic relevance and word count were identified as important indicators of their journal grades. Based on the patterns discovered by topic modeling, prediction models were developed to automate the assessing and grading of reflection journals. The findings indicate the potential of topic modeling in serving as an analytic tool for teachers to explore and assess students\\' reflective thoughts in written journals.; Language and ideology in congress -- Legislative speech records from the 101st to 108th Congresses of the US Senate are analysed to study political ideologies. A widely-used text classification algorithm - Support Vector Machines (SVM) - allows the extraction of terms that are most indicative of conservative and liberal positions in legislative speeches and the prediction of senators\\' ideological positions, with a 92 per cent level of accuracy. Feature analysis identifies the terms associated with conservative and liberal ideologies. The results demonstrate that cultural references appear more important than economic references in distinguishing conservative from liberal congressional speeches, calling into question the common economic interpretation of ideological differences in the US Congress.; 3rd International Workshop on news recommendation and analytics (INRA 2015) -- The 3rd International Workshop on News Recommendation and Analytics (INRA 2015) is held in conjunction with RecSys 2015 Conference in Vienna, Austria. This paper presents a brief summary of the INRA 2015. This workshop aims to create an interdisciplinary community that addresses design issues in news recommender systems and news analytics, and promote fruitful collaboration opportunities between researchers, media companies and practitioners. We have a keynote speaker and an invited demo presentation in addition to 4 papers accepted in this workshop.; Documenting business-to-consumer (B2C) communications on facebook -- Purpose – The purpose of this study is to document how restaurant’s business-to-consumer communication strategies evolved on Facebook over time and how consumers’ reactions to a variety of Facebook messages changed over time. Design/methodology/approach – This study analyzed 2,463 Facebook messages posted by seven quick-service restaurant chains and three casual-dining restaurant chains in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2012 and 2014. ANOVA and post hoc t-test were used to compare the differences among four media types (photo, status update, video and hyperlink) in terms of their usage by companies and Facebook users’ reactions to these messages (measured by number of “Likes”, number of comments and number of shares). Findings – Over the three periods of time under observation, there is a substantial decrease of status updates by restaurants and a dramatic increase of photo updates. Photo remained as the most “popular” media type, receiving most “Likes”, comments and shares from consumers. Video was not considered “popular” in 2010 but experienced a slight increase in usage and slowly emerged in 2012 and 2014 as another “popular” media, which no longer had statistical difference with photo in number of comments and shares. Research limitations/implications – Some limitations include an under representable sample and its longitudinal design, but the fndings provide additional insight to current literature in social media. Practical implications – A series of suggestions were advanced from the fndings to help hospitality managers better engage Facebook users. Originality/value – This is probably the frst time-series or longitudinal-like analysis in social media research and yields meaningful fndings.; Exploring the relationship between mood and creativity in rock lyrics -- The relationship between mood and creativity has been widely studied in psychology, however, no conclusion is reached in terms of which mood triggers high creativity, positive or negative. This paper provides new insights to this on-going argument by examining the relationship between lyrics creativity and music mood. We use three computational measures to gauge lyrics creativity: Type-to- Token Ratio, word norms fraction, and WordNet similarity. We then test three hypotheses regarding differences in lyrics creativity between music with different moods on 2715 U.S. rock songs. The three measures led to consistent findings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate higher linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs. Our findings support previous studies in psycholinguistics that people write more creatively when the text conveys sad or negative sentiment, and contradict previous research that positive mood triggers more unusual word associations. The result also indicates that different measures capture different aspects of lyrics creativity.; Teaching information science and technology to the world? Practices, challenges and visions -- Information science and technology (IST) has made unprecedented impacts on society. Teaching IST should by no means be limited within the boundary of the discipline. Based on their experiences in teaching IST in various levels, speakers in this panel will reflect the past, share current practices and envision the future of teaching IST to the world. Collectively we aim to stimulate further discussions on increasing the impact of the field through education.; Spreading Social Media Messages on Facebook -- As a method of determining what types of social media messages work best for hospitality firms, this study examined what types of messages gained the most clicks of \"Like\" and comments on Facebook. An analysis of the number of likes and comments regarding nine hundred and eighty-two Facebook messages from ten restaurant chains and two independent operators revealed clear patterns. The more popular keywords involved information about the restaurant (e.g., menu descriptions) and the less popular messages were those that contained marketing-related words (including \"winner\" and \"check\"). Dividing the messages into four media types, namely, status (text only), link (containing a URL), video (embedding a video), and photo (showing photos), revealed that photo and status receive more likes and comments than the other two categories. Social media messages can also be categorized into two message types: sales and marketing (about two-thirds of the messages in this study) and conversational messages. Based on number of likes and comments, conversational messages are endorsed by more Facebook users. Finally, cross-effects of media type and message type affect the number of comments a message received. Although these results do not expressly assess Facebook users\\' reactions, the guidelines developed here should help managers improve their use of Facebook, as well as provide groundwork for developing a defined typology of Facebook messages and an automatic text classifier with the machine learning techniques.; Taxonomy of Facebook messages in business-to-consumer communications -- This research combines machine learning and human intelligence to analyze 2654 Facebook messages initiated by 26 hospitality companies to develop the taxonomy of Facebook messages in business-toconsumer (B2C) communications. Facebook messages can be classified into two broad message types: Sales/Marketing messages, with five sub-categories of Social Responsibility, Direct Boasting, Indirect Boasting, Product Highlight, and Campaign/Sales, and Conversational messages, with four sub-categories of Call for Action, Provoke Feedback, Advice/Suggestions, and Updates. By comparison, Conversational messages received more \"Likes\" and comments than Sales/Marketing messages. Direct Boasting, Product Highlight, Call for Action, Provoke Feedback, Advice/Suggestions, and Updates received more \"Likes\" than other types; Provoke Feedback and Call for Action received more comments. As compared to current literature, the results allow managers to advance more specific strategies to better engage with Facebook users and provide a more thorough taxonomy for additional analysis on companies\\' B2C messages on other social media websites.; The 7 Ps marketing mix of home-sharing services -- The 7 Ps model is a very useful tool in helping service firms solve managerial issues in marketing. Guided by the 7 Ps marketing mix framework, a big-data, supervised machine learning analysis was performed with 1,148,062 English reviews of 37,092 Airbnb listings in San Francisco and New York City. The results disclose similar patterns in both markets, where travelers shared their experience about Service Product and Physical Evidence most often; Price and Promotion were the least mentioned elements. Furthermore, through a series of comparisons of Airbnb\\'s 7 Ps marketing mix among the listings managed by different types of hosts, multi-unit and single-unit hosts seem to offer similar services with a small observable difference; whereas superhosts and the ordinary hosts deliver different services. This study makes valuable methodological contributions and provides practical marketing insights for hoteliers and the hosts and webmasters on home-sharing websites. Policymakers should pay special attention to multi-unit hosts.; Identifying Finding Sentences in Conclusion Subsections of Biomedical Abstracts -- Segmenting scientific abstracts and full-text based on their rhetorical function is an essential task in text classification. Small rhetorical segments can be useful for fine-grained literature search, summarization, and comparison. Current effort has been focusing on segmenting documents into general sections such as introduction, method, and conclusion, and much less on the roles of individual sentences within the segments. For example, not all sentences in the conclusion section are describing research findings. In this work, we developed rule-based and machine learning methods and compared their performance in identifying the finding sentences in conclusion subsections of biomedical abstracts. 1100 conclusion subsections with observational and randomized clinical trials study designs covering five common health topics were sampled from PubMed to develop and evaluate the methods. The rule-based method and the bag-of-words based machine learning method both achieved high accuracy. The better performance by the simple rule-based approach shows that although advanced machine learning approaches could capture the main patterns, human expert may still outperform on such a specialized task.; Interventions to support consumer evaluation of online health information credibility -- Purpose: Various interventions have been designed to help consumers better evaluate the credibility of online health information (OHI). However, assessing information credibility remained the most widely reported challenge by online health consumers. This review aims to provide an overview of major intervention approaches for improving consumer ability to evaluate OHI credibility in order to identify opportunities for future interventions. Methods: A scoping review was performed. Seven relevant scientific databases were searched to identify articles that report the design and/or evaluation of interventions to support, facilitate, or assist consumers in assessing the credibility of OHI. Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. Relevant content was extracted from the articles and all codes were validated by second coders. Results: Three major intervention approaches for enhancing consumers\\' ability to evaluate OHI credibility were identified: educational program, algorithm, and interactive interface. The design of most interventions (particularly the credibility evaluation component) lacked the guidance of theories, and very few studies systematically evaluated their effectiveness in real online search contexts. Few interventions can provide spontaneous support to consumers while they search online. Conclusion: Our understanding of what theoretical constructs contribute to effective OHI credibility evaluation interventions and how intervention outcomes should be measured remained limited. Future efforts need to focus on the design, development, test, and evaluation of theory-guided OHI credibility evaluation interventions that are scalable, sustainable, and can provide real-time support to consumers.; Collecting representative pictures for words -- This poster proposes a human computation approach to collecting representative pictures for words so that the collected pictures can efficiently and effectively convey the meaning of the words or concepts. A large collection of representative pictures can be used in text-to-picture communication systems, and may also be used to teach computers to learn what representative pictures are. We have developed a web application to help players of Draw Something, a popular social mobile game, search pictures for drawing inspiration while at the same time they implicitly help us collect representative pictures for words. Our preliminary result shows that the proposed approach has the potential to harvest Draw Something players for collecting desired data.; Sentence recall game -- Recently we ran a simple memory test experiment, called sentence recall, in which participants were asked to recall sentences that they had just seen on the screen. Many participants, especially non-native English speakers, made various deviations in their recalled sentences. Some deviations represent alternative ways to express the same meaning, but others suggest that there are missing pieces in the participants\\' language knowledge. The deviation data, on the one hand, can provide individual users valuable feedback on their language usage patterns that they may never notice, on the other hand, can be used as training data for automatically discovering language usage patterns in a subpopulation of language learners. This paper presents our attempts to create an enjoyable sentence recall game for collecting a large amount of deviation data. Our results show that the game is fun to play and the collected deviation data can reveal common language usage patterns among non-native speakers.; Toward predicting popularity of social marketing messages -- Popularity of social marketing messages indicates the effectiveness of the corresponding marketing strategies. This research aims to discover the characteristics of social marketing messages that contribute to different level of popularity. Using messages posted by a sample of restaurants on Facebook as a case study, we measured the message popularity by the number of \"likes\" voted by fans, and examined the relationship between the message popularity and two properties of the messages: (1) content, and (2) media type. Combining a number of text mining and statistics methods, we have discovered some interesting patterns correlated to \"more popular\" and \"less popular\" social marketing messages. This work lays foundation for building computational models to predict the popularity of social marketing messages in the future.; Collecting legacy corpora from social science research for text mining evaluation -- In this poster we describe a pilot study of searching social science literature for legacy corpora to evaluate text mining algorithms. The new emerging field of computational social science demands large amount of social science data to train and evaluate computational models. We argue that the legacy corpora that were annotated by social science researchers through traditional Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) are ideal data sets to evaluate text mining methods, such as text categorization and clustering. As a pilot study, we searched articles that involve content analysis and discourse analysis in leading communication journals, and then contacted the authors regarding the availability of the annotated texts. Regretfully, nearly all of the corpora that we found were not adequately maintained, and many were no longer available, even though they were less than ten years old. This situation calls for more effort to better maintain and use legacy social science data for future computational social science research purpose.; Crowdsourcing participatory evaluation of medical pictograms using amazon mechanical turk -- Background: Consumer and patient participation proved to be an effective approach for medical pictogram design, but it can be costly and time-consuming. We proposed and evaluated an inexpensive approach that crowdsourced the pictogram evaluation task to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers, who are usually referred to as the \"turkers\". Objective: To answer two research questions: (1) Is the turkers\\' collective effort effective for identifying design problems in medical pictograms? and (2) Do the turkers\\' demographic characteristics affect their performance in medical pictogram comprehension? Methods: We designed a Web-based survey (open-ended tests) to ask 100 US turkers to type in their guesses of the meaning of 20 US pharmacopeial pictograms. Two judges independently coded the turkers\\' guesses into four categories: correct, partially correct, wrong, and completely wrong. The comprehensibility of a pictogram was measured by the percentage of correct guesses, with each partially correct guess counted as 0.5 correct. We then conducted a content analysis on the turkers\\' interpretations to identify misunderstandings and assess whether the misunderstandings were common. We also conducted a statistical analysis to examine the relationship between turkers\\' demographic characteristics and their pictogram comprehension performance. Results: The survey was completed within 3 days of our posting the task to the MTurk, and the collected data are publicly available in the multimedia appendix for download. The comprehensibility for the 20 tested pictograms ranged from 45% to 98%, with an average of 72.5%. The comprehensibility scores of 10 pictograms were strongly correlated to the scores of the same pictograms reported in another study that used oral response-based open-ended testing with local people. The turkers\\' misinterpretations shared common errors that exposed design problems in the pictograms. Participant performance was positively correlated with their educational level. Conclusions: The results confirmed that crowdsourcing can be used as an effective and inexpensive approach for participatory evaluation of medical pictograms. Through Web-based open-ended testing, the crowd can effectively identify problems in pictogram designs. The results also confirmed that education has a significant effect on the comprehension of medical pictograms. Since low-literate people are underrepresented in the turker population, further investigation is needed to examine to what extent turkers\\' misunderstandings overlap with those elicited from low-literate people.; Language and gender in congressional speech -- This study draws from a large corpus of Congressional speeches from the 101st to the 110th Congress (1989-2008), to examine gender differences in language use in a setting of political debates. Female legislators\\' speeches demonstrated characteristics of both a feminine language style (e.g. more use of emotion words, fewer articles) and a masculine one (e.g. more nouns and long words, fewer personal pronouns). A trend analysis found that these gender differences have consistently existed in the Congressional speeches over the past 20 years, regardless of the topic of debate. The findings lend support to the argument that gender differences in language use persist in professional settings like the floor of Congress.; The emotional world of health online communities -- This article presents a preliminary study on the emotional world of health online communities. Using sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques, this study aims to (1) examine the strength of various kinds of emotions (positivity, optimism, negativity, anxiety, anger, and sadness) in online health forum discussions, and (2) compare the emotional status and expression of forum participants under different roles, such as askers and answerers, men and women, and caregivers and patients. This study is expected to improve the understanding of the emotional communication in online health communities.; Automated citation sentiment analysis -- Automated citation sentiment analysis is a newly emerged research topic inspired by traditional citation context analysis in scientometrics and applied linguistics. The main goals of current citation sentiment analysis are to develop new tools to model scientific literature and provide authoring support for researchers in tasks like literature review. In terms of developing authoring support tools, however, current studies have not taken into consideration the behavioral patterns of researchers\\' literature review practice, leaving user need assessment as a missing piece in current interdisciplinary research effort. This paper analyzed biomedical researchers\\' need by reviewing their publications on using manual citation sentiment analysis for detecting citation bias, and discussed the differences between biomedical researchers\\' approach and current automated citation sentiment analysis model. These differences are expected to inform the modeling of automated citation sentiment analysis.; Auto-tracking controversial topics in social-media-based customer dialog -- This study proposed and validated a topic modeling-based approach for auto-tracking customer dialog on social media, using Starbucks as a case study because of its pioneering social media practice in service industry. A topic model was fit based on nearly 150,000 customer comments posted to Starbucks’ Facebook page in 2013. This model was able to identify not only business-related topics, such as customer responses to marketing campaigns, but also controversial topics regarding community involvement and corporate social responsibility, such as gay, gun, and government. Guided by this topic model, each topic’s evolving dynamics and patterns of user participation were further revealed, providing a bird’s-eye view of the topics and their evolution. The case study has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively track the main themes in the customer dialog on social media, zoom in on the controversial topics, measure their time spans, and locate the participants and the vocal activists. Such information would be valuable input for companies to design their intervention strategies and evaluate the outcomes in social media discussions.; Detecting causal language use in science findings -- Causal interpretation of correlational findings from observational studies has been a major type of misinformation in science communication. Prior studies on identifying inappropriate use of causal language relied on manual content analysis, which is not scalable for examining a large volume of science publications. In this study, we first annotated a corpus of over 3,000 PubMed research conclusion sentences, then developed a BERT-based prediction model that classifies conclusion sentences into “no relationship”, “correlational”, “conditional causal”, and “direct causal” categories, achieving an accuracy of 0.90 and a macroF1 of 0.88. We then applied the prediction model to measure the causal language use in the research conclusions of about 38,000 observational studies in PubMed. The prediction result shows that 21.7% studies used direct causal language exclusively in their conclusions, and 32.4% used some direct causal language. We also found that the ratio of causal language use differs among authors from different countries, challenging the notion of a shared consensus on causal language use in the global science community. Our prediction model could also be used to help identify the inappropriate use of causal language in science publications.; Measuring Correlation-to-Causation Exaggeration in Press Releases -- Press releases have an increasingly strong influence on media coverage of health research; however, they have been found to contain seriously exaggerated claims that can misinform the public and undermine public trust in science. In this study we propose an NLP approach to identify exaggerated causal claims made in health press releases that report on observational studies, which are designed to establish correlational findings, but are often exaggerated as causal. We developed a new corpus and trained models that can identify causal claims in the main statements in a press release. By comparing the claims made in a press release with the corresponding claims in the original research paper, we found that 22% of press releases made exaggerated causal claims from correlational findings in observational studies. Furthermore, universities exaggerated more often than journal publishers by a ratio of 1.5 to 1. Encouragingly, the exaggeration rate has slightly decreased over the past 10 years, despite the increase of the total number of press releases. More research is needed to understand the cause of the decreasing pattern.; HClaimE -- This study tackles the problem of extracting health claims from health research news headlines, in order to carry out veracity check. A health claim can be formally defined as a triplet consisting of an independent variable (IV – namely, what is being manipulated), a dependent variable (DV – namely, what is being measured), and the relation between the two. In this study, we develop HClaimE, an information extraction tool for identifying health claims in news headlines. Unlike the existing open information extraction (OpenIE) systems that rely on verbs as relation indicators, HClaimE focuses on finding relations between nouns, and draws on the linguistic characteristics of news headlines. HClaimE uses a Naïve Bayes classifier that combines syntactic and lexical features for identifying IV and DV nouns, and recognizes relations between IV and DV through a rule-based method. We conducted an evaluation on a set of health news headlines from ScienceDaily.com, and the results show that HClaimE outperforms current OpenIE systems: the F-measures for identifying headlines without health claims is 0.60 and that for extracting IV-relation-DV is 0.69. Our study shows that nouns can provide more clues than verbs for identifying health claims in news headlines. Furthermore, it also shows that dependency relations and bag-of-words can distinguish IV-DV noun pairs from other noun pairs. In practice, HClaimE can be used as a helpful tool to identifying health claims in news headlines, which can then be further compared against authoritative health claims for veracity. Given the linguistic similarity between health claims and other causal claims, e.g., impacts of pollution on the environment, HClaimE may also be applicable for extracting claims in other domains.; Information quality of reddit link posts on health news -- Inaccuracy has been a common problem in news coverage of scientific research. This problem has been particularly prevalent in health research news. Health research news usually spreads from research publications and press releases to news and social media. In this study we examined the information quality of the Reddit link posts that introduce health news stories. We developed a coding schema to annotate the inaccurate information in a sample of 250 link posts on health research news within the Reddit community r/Health in 2018. The result shows that most link posts simply copied the original news headlines verbatim, while some paraphrased the news stories by adding, deleting, replacing, and combining content. We found that 12 paraphrased link posts contained inaccurate information that may mislead the readers. The most common type of inaccuracy is exaggeration resulted from changing the original speculative claims to direct causal statements by removing the modal verbs such as “may” and “might”. The result shows that although the link posts of health news were generally faithful to the original news stories, exaggerated claims may lead to false hope for researchers and patients.'"
